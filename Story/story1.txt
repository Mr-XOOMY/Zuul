On a bright Sunday morning where sunlight shone through the trees and skies were blue,
Bilbo Baggins was enjoying his tranquil day smoking his pipe, while sitting on his bench in the front garden.
Up until when a tall man of old age appeared in front of him. He introduced himself being Gandalf the Grey,

'Can I help you?' Bilbo asked. 

Gandalf replied; 'I am in search of someone to share in an adventure'. 

Bilbo was surprised to say the least. 'An adventure?' He asked. 'No, I can't imagine anyone west of Bree would have much interest in adventures.
Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things, make you late for dinner!'

'It would be very good for you, and most amusing for me. Very well, that's decided. I shall inform the others.'

 'No, no, we do not want any adventures here, not today, never.
I suggest you try over the hill or across the water. Good morning.'

As Bilbo walked back into his house, shut the door and hid behind it awaiting the departure of the wizard, Gandalf carved a 'Fehu'-rune into his door. And walked away.
