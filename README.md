# Bilbo's Quest

Bilbo's Quest is a school project. For this project we have to create a java text based adventure game.
Our subject is Bilbo's Quest which is our own version of the Hobbit.

If you want the source code then you can clone this repository.

If you want to run this game, you can download a .zip file from this link.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEZsDQcssyt0tJuK4YnA0_wz2IA83lYi/view?usp=sharing

When you extract this .zip file the newly created folder will contain some folders, a .jar file and some scripts.
Run the corresponding script, .bat and .ps1 for Windows and .sh for Linux, to start the game.

When these scripts do not start the game, you can always start a cli in this folder location and run the game with te following command:

"java -jar ./BilbosQuest.jar"

For best experience, please run the game fullscreen.

The extra documentation for the game is in the Documentation folder and the javadocs in the javadoc folder. If you open allclasses.html with a web browser, you will be able to click through the javadoc documentation.

We hope you enjoy this game.
