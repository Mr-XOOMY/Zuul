Finally, he saw the noble company of Gandalf and the 13 dwarfs and shouted from the top of his lungs ‘Wait, wait!, I have signed the contract!’. 

Surprised yet happy looks aimed upon him as he approached one of the dwarfs and handed over the contract. On which the dwarf inspected the signature and said: ‘Everything appears to be in order. Welcome Master Baggins… to the company of Thorin Oakenshield!’ All were happy and cheered for the Hobbits’ decision to aid them in their quest to reclaim the treasure which his rightfully theirs.

They passed the gates and were welcomed by Lord Elrond, leader of the elves and invited the company for dinner.

Yet, as stubborn Thorin is, he refused to hand the over his peoples’ secrets to the treasure which is hid in the mountain.
